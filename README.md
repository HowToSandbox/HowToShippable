HowToShippable
==============

# Why
Continuous integration is a thing. Shorten the feedback loop. Run your tests on every commit. Shippable has a free tier for public AND private repo's. It's kind of like Travis, but not quite. Go Go Gadget Tests. We've all know it's a good plan, M'kay. Now on to...

# How
* Sign up for shippable with your github account
* In 'Manage Services' on Shippable turn on Public and Private repos
* Enable the repository you want to put under CI
* Add a shippable.yml to the base of your repo 
* Commit your code
* Watch your build run on the shippable dashboard
