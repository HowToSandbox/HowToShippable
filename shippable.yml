# Shippable will runs the gemfile. If anything in the gemfile depends on anything being installed on the file
# system, you need to install it in the before_install
#

# before_install tag
before_install:
  - gem update --system
  - gem --version  #Everything you do in the console will be in the log, so you can use this kind of thing to get information
 
 ## This stuff is just here as an example of how to maipulate the file system if you need to
 # - mkdir ~/Downloads
 # - curl 'ftp://ftp.freetds.org/pub/freetds/stable/freetds-stable.tgz' -o ~/Downloads/freetds-stable.tgz
 # - cd ~/Downloads
 # - tar -zxvf freetds-stable.tgz
 # - cd freetds-0.91/
 # - ./configure
 # - make
 # - sudo make install


# write the rspec tests to the output dir
script:
  - spec -f JUnit -o shippable/testresults/results.xml #this turns your spec results into something shipable understands
  - rake spec:spec # Then just run all your things
